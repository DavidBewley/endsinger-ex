        Watch the sequence play out and wait for the 4 numbers appear. Click the correct number where you should move your character to.
        <ul>
            <li>The numbers are the number of rings around the Meteion heads.</li>
            <li>The Arrow is the direction the middle Meteion is looking.</li>
            <li>You have 9 seconds to select a number or you lose.</li>
            <li>You can change your answer by clicking again.</li>
            <li>Refresh the page to try again.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        If the screen looks wrong with objects in the wrong place then refresh the page to fix it. This is a bug!
